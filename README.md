The repository contains my coding assignments and notes for 
the online coursework taken on 
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## How to use
The dependencies required for the project are available in 
`pyproject.toml` file. You can install these using pip
after creating a virtual environment:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

Or, if you use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), you
can use sync command to create a virtual environment and
set it up:
```sh
uv sync
```

The project has been developed in Python 3.12.

Once the environment is setup, follow the instructions in
the README of individual modules to run specific
applications.
